    <blockquote>
      <p>In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and
        thousand-and-one
        items to be allowed for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his
        port
        at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify.
      </p>

    <h2>why?</h2>
    <p>I saw
      <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1030985251940491266">this tweet</a> by
      <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg">Guillermo Rauch</a> on Twitter. I figured it was a good challenge.</p>
    <h3>inspiration</h3>
    <p>I recently came across
      <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite.com</a> and the one-upped version
      <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com</a>. I like the idea of using a
      minimal set of
      <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to make semantic
      <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> look good.

    <h2>how</h2>
    <p>Check out the well-commented source
      <code>var something = 'whatever';</code> code to see
      <small>small stuff here</small> where I got some of my ideas. Here's some lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
    <h2>focus</h2>
    <p>This won't cover every situation. The focus is on typography and writing. Inputs and buttons aren't touched.
      While some
      styles come from normalize.css, not everything does.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Just a bulleted list</li>
      <li>Nothing much to see here except that this one keeps going on and on so we can see what it looks like when it
        wraps
        to the next line.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Do you want a separator
      <sub>log</sub> before this ordered list that comes next? Okay, that's cool, what if I told you
      <q>this was in quotes?</q>
      </q>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What about an
        <em>ordered list?</em>
      </li>
      <li>Well what do you think you're looking at?</li>
      <li>I'm just going to keep</li>
      <li>Making some more
        <sup>1</sup>
      </li>
      <li>Items in this list</li>
      <li>Because I want to see</li>
      <li>What it would look like</li>
      <li>If it
        <sup>2</sup> went into</li>
      <li>Double digits</li>
      <li>Just a few more...</li>
